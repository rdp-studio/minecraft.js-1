# MinecraftJS

MinecraftJS brings the best-selling PC game "Minecraft" into the web with the power of javascript.

# Motivation

Having to open an additional app to play a game is sometimes too tiring. Therefore, we thought it'd be interesting to somehow implement Minecraft with javascript, essentially bringing the whole Minecraft game into the web. This not only takes away the tedious process of installing the game, it also brings the entire game to players with a couple clicks.
